                PHP has a very powerful open source ecosystem. There are a lot of developers and a lot of companies that work
                and put effort on some of the best libraries with wich we can use to build our applications.
                Penny was born to manage integration between your favorite libraries and it does not force you to use nothing you don't want to.
